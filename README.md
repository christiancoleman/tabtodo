# Tab-To-Do Chrome Addon

The Tab-To-Do addon \(Id = [pjajmbdjiiboeoaaplgcigkmcljimddm](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-to-do/pjajmbdjiiboeoaaplgcigkmcljimddm)\) has been pulled from the [Chrome Web Store - Main Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), and the associated web site - [Tab-To-Do.com](https://tabtodo.com) - also appears to be inaccessible. I really liked this addon mainly because of its dependable ability<b><sup>\*</sup></b> to sticky-rename<b><sup>\*\*</sup></b> my Chrome tabs. 

Using the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) I was able to look at a very old version of the Tabtodo.com website)<b><sup>\*\*\*</sup></b>. Either way - on it<b><sup>\*\*\*\*</sup></b>, it had a link to a [Github repository](https://github.com/tabtodo/tabtodo/) that still exists as of 2019-05-08... It just hadn't been updated for roughly 4 years. :thumbsdown:

So this is when I found out that Chrome extensions are stored client-side and therefore the newest version of the addon should be saved locally on my machine.

> Chrome addons can be found at: C:\Users\\_*\{username\}*_\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\\_*\{appId\}*_

where the _*\{appId\}*_ is the same identifier used in chrome web store i.e. pjajmbdjiiboeoaaplgcigkmcljimddm.

# So what are my goals?

* Analyzing the code for v2.1
* Refactoring where possible
* Exploring Chrome extension development options, standards, etc.

<b><sup>\*</sup></b> By sticky-rename I mean that the addon could rename a Chrome tab and that name would persist regardless of whether you clicked links within the page or refreshed the browser.

<b><sup>\*\*</sup></b> dependability?? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

<b><sup>\*\*\*</sup></b> Or was it the web store page? I know I looked up both. I just forget which one lead me to it.

<b><sup>\*\*\*\*<sup></b> Whatever that was...
