#Tab-To-Do Chrome Addon

It seems the Tab-To-Do addon (id[](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pjajmbdjiiboeoaaplgcigkmcljimddm) has been pulled from the Chrome store, and the associated web site - tabtodo.com - appears to no longer be with us either. I really liked this addon mainly because of it's dependable ability to sticky-rename my Chrome tabs. 

Using the Wayback Machine I was able to look at a very old version of the Tabtodo.com website. On it, it had a link to a github repository and it still exists as of 2019-05-08, but hadn't been updated for \~4 years. Link: https://github.com/tabtodo/tabtodo/

Even better is the fact that Chrome addons are stored client-side and therefore the newest (I think?) version of the addon is saved locally on my machine.

Chrome addons can be found at: C:\Users\\_*\{username}*_\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\.

The name of the folder is the same identifier used in it's link in extension store i.e. pjajmbdjiiboeoaaplgcigkmcljimddm.

#So what am I doing?

Right now, I'm just putting everything I found in one place and in a logical order. Then I'm going to compare the different versions. Afterwards I'll learn a bit about deploying extensions and maybe look into reigniting the project independently. I don't want to commit myself to constantly updating it and/or fielding feature requests/bugs so it'd be on a I-hope-it-works-for-you-but-it-definitely-works-for-me basis :P

#Comparisons

`tabtodo15.zip` == `tabtodo/tabtodo/src`
* The above is true except that `tutorial.html` exists in the  `src` folder but was not added to the `zip` file
